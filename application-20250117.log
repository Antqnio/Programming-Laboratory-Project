It is the resting place of the Conch Horn, one of the eight Instruments of the Sirens. The entrance to this Dungeon is located within Goponga Swamp, north of the Mysterious Forest and is surrounded by swampy Water fitting with the Dungeon being named a Grotto, which is a cave located near a source of Water and is prone to flooding, although no Water can actually be found within the Dungeon. BowWow is needed to enter, as the entrance is completely blocked by Goponga Flowers, which cannot be destroyed by using any of the weapons Link currently has available to him. The interior of this Dungeon is mostly gray flooring and blue walls. The main tool of the Dungeon is the Power Bracelet, which is required to lift the numerous Pots and the Genie's Bottle which the level is named after. The mini-boss is a Hinox. "}]
