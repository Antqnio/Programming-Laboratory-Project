It was highly anticipated by many members of the gaming community and was regarded as finally fulfilling the dreams of those who wanted a much more realistic and mature Zelda game, as seen in the SpaceWorld 2000 GameCube Tech Demo. This is the first Zelda game to be rated T by ESRB and 12+ by PEGI. The reason is probably because of violence, blood , and signs of nudity . This game is also notable for being the first console Zelda title released in the United States before Japan, as the Wii version was released in America on November 19, 2006, whereas the Japanese versions were released on December 2. Because of this, Twilight Princess was one of the launch titles for the Wii alongside Wii Sports in the United States.
